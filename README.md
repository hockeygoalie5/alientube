# Testing
To test, clone the repository, then follow one of the two methods:

## With `web-ext`
If you have `web-ext` installed, simply navigate to the extension root in your terminal and run `web-ext run`. The extension will load in a clean version of your default firefox profile. See further options and instructions on installing `web-ext` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext).

## Without `web-ext`
If you do not have `web-ext` and do not want to install it, you can open FireFox and navigate to `about:debugging`. Select "Load Temporary Add-on", navigate to the extension root, and select any file in that directory. The extension will load immediatally. See further instructions [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox).

# Translation
If you want to help translate RoYT, check the [`_locales`](https://github.com/mustafakalash/royt/tree/master/_locales) directory for already existing translations and the localisation format. Only the `message` key of each section needs to be translated. Modified `messages.json` files can be sent to me or updated in a pull request. Thank you!
